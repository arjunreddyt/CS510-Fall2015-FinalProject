This project objecive is to contsruct a complex plane by storing values in matrices. It is implemeted in C and C++ languages. 
This project consists of several programs, the description is as follows.

generate_output.sh-Bash script to generate csv files of C-JuliaSets and Cpp-Mandelbrot.

plot_data.py-Python script that reads a csv file and plots the values.

complex.c-Add, multiply, square, and create the juliamap of complex numbers.


julia.c-Inputs for the cplane constructor.

Makefile-compiles complex.c, cplane.c, and julia.c.

cplane.cpp-storing complex numbers using boost

mandelbrot.cpp-Generates the set.
